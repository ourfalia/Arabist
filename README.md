- ### Design

  - #### Design Process and Reasoning:

  - The design process for the Arabista Restaurant Website followed a user-centered approach, focusing on creating an intuitive and visually appealing experience for visitors. The key steps undertaken during the design process included research, ideation, prototyping, testing, and refinement.

  Extensive user research was conducted to gain insights into the target audience, their preferences, and expectations when visiting a restaurant website. This research informed the design decisions and helped create a user-centric interface.

  The core design principles guiding the Arabista website were elegance, simplicity, and a touch of Middle Eastern culture. The goal was to convey a warm and welcoming atmosphere that reflects the essence of Arab cuisine.

  - #### Wireframes:

  Wireframes were created as a blueprint for the Arabista website, outlining the layout, structure, and key elements of each page. These wireframes illustrate the placement of navigation menus, content sections, imagery, and interactive components. They serve as a foundation for further design iterations and development.
